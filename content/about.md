Hi! I am Sarita. 

I am an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. Currently I am in my third year of study at the institute completing my B.Tech degree with major in Computer Science and Engineering. My usual way of going about everything in life is: "Learning. Breaking. Unlearning. Building.". Drawing is one of my favorite pastimes. It helps me to escape the chaos and immerse myself in creativity and self-expression. A funny part about me though - I absolutely loooove **Paperboats**.
